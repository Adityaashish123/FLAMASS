WeatherTrack - Android Weather Monitoring App
I have uploaded the zip file of the android application
Description:
WeatherTrack is an Android application that allows users to track daily weather stats in their city. It fetches weather data (temperature, humidity, and condition) from a mock API or static JSON file, stores the data locally every 6 hours using Room, and displays a summary view showing temperature trends over the past week. The app is built using Java and follows the MVVM or Clean Architecture pattern.

Feature Requirements:

Fetch Weather:

Get weather data (temperature, humidity, condition) from a mock API or static JSON.

Each data fetch is saved locally using Room database with a timestamp.

Auto Background Sync:

Uses WorkManager to schedule a sync job every 6 hours that fetches and saves the latest weather.

Users can also manually refresh the weather data via a button in the app.

Weekly Summary Screen:

Displays a graph or list of temperature changes over the past 7 days.

Users can click on a specific day to view detailed weather information for that day.

App Architecture:

Built using Java (no Kotlin).

Follows MVVM or Clean Architecture.

Layers: UI (Activities/Fragments), ViewModel, Repository, Data Source (Room, mock API).

Error Handling:

Displays user-friendly error messages in the following scenarios:
a) No internet connection
b) API errors
c) Local database errors

Tech Stack:

Java

Room for local database storage

WorkManager for background syncing

LiveData or Observables for reactive UI updates

No external libraries for graphs (custom drawing or simple list-based UI)

Instructions:

Open the project in Android Studio.

Ensure that the static JSON or mock API endpoint is correctly set up.

Run the application on a device or emulator.

To test background sync, wait or trigger WorkManager manually via developer options.
